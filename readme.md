# the Hofmann Elimination

## Purpose

This project provides a protocol to create consistent,
reusable identifiers across multiple clients without sharing the
key data used to make up that identifier. This results in an identifier that can
be used with services without those services knowing the origins of the data used.
Useful when that data is based on information one does not want to expose
outside of the owning client. This implements the Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF)
protocol using hash-to-curve techniques to achieve this goal.

# Protocol

The protocol relies on the following data types:
- `P`: A point on an elliptic curve derived from the input text using a hash-to-curve function.
- `r`: A random blinding factor chosen by the client to ensure that the blinded point `Q` is different for each submission, even for the same input.
- `Q`: The blinded point computed by the client as `Q = P · r`.
- `s`: A master secret key held by the service.
- `R`: The blinded (ec point) result computed by the service as `R = Q · s = P · r · s`.
- `U`: The unblinded (ec point) result computed by the client as `U = r⁻¹ · R = s·P`.

The protocol flow is as follows:

```
Client                          Service
────────                        ───────
1. P = HashToCurve(text)
2. Q = P · r
3. Send Q  ─────────────────►   R = Q · s
           ◄─────────────────   R = P · r · s
4. U = R · r⁻¹ = P · s
5. identityKey = BLAKE3(U)
``` 

## Details for each step

1. The client takes the input text and applies a hash-to-curve function to derive a point `P` on the elliptic curve.
2. The client computes the blinded point `Q` by multiplying `P` with a random blinding factor `r`.
3. The client sends the blinded point `Q` to the service. The service computes `R` by multiplying `Q` with the master key `s`. This results in `R = s · P · r`.
4. The client receives `R` and unblinds it by multiplying with the inverse of the blinding factor `r`, yielding `U = s·P`.
5. Finally, the client can derive a consistent identity key from `U` using the hash function BLAKE3.

## Useful classes

- `Client` : Shows in detail what the client is doing for the protocol. See `convertToIdentityKey()` for the main workflow.
- `Server` : The API requirements for a basic system to allow for clients to create new keys.
- `ServerImpl` : Naive implementation that implements the protocol in a basic way.
- `Curve` : Default behavior needed from any Curve implementation. Uses Bouncy Castle as that should be C# compatible.
- `RoundTripTest` : Examples of how it works and to verify the code is sound.

## OPAQUE / aPAKE
The OPAQUE Augmented Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE) protocol is a primary
inspiration for this project. OPAQUE allows two parties to cooperate to securely compute
a pseudorandom function over an insecure channel without revealing the input to the other party.
The OPRF component is key, as it allows the client to compute a blinded version of the password
without revealing it to the server.

## OPRF
Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a cryptographic mechanism that allows
one party (the client) to compute a pseudorandom function on an input without
revealing the input to the other party (the server). The server holds a secret
key that is used to compute the pseudorandom function, but it does not learn
anything about the client's input. This is used for things like password hashing
and secure multi-party computation.

## Hash-to-Curve
Hash-to-curve is a technique used in elliptic curve cryptography to map arbitrary
input data (such as a string) to a point on an elliptic curve.
Protocols like OPRF use this technique to derive a point on the curve from the
input text. The hash-to-curve process ensures that the resulting point is
uniformly distributed on the curve. That uniform distribution is needed for security applications.

Implemented the [RFC 9380](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9380.html) specification, but note it was implemented via Claude Code.
The original approximation is included as well. Expect changes there as I evaluate the work
done by Claude and look for security or implementation issues.

## Origins of the name

The [Hofmann Elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofmann_elimination) is a chemical reaction that involves the elimination of an amine to produce an alkene. This reaction is named after the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann, who first described it in the 19th century. The Hofmann elimination is often used to synthesize alkenes from amines. It does this by treating the quaternary ammonium salt with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide, which leads to the elimination of the ammonium group and the formation of an alkene. The reaction is typically carried out under heat to facilitate the elimination process.

Unlike other elimination reactions, the Hofmann elimination produces the least substituted alkene as the major product, which is a result of the steric hindrance around the quaternary ammonium salt. This makes it a useful reaction for synthesizing specific alkenes that may be difficult to obtain through other methods.
